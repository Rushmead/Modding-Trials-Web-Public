Dear Competitor,

Thanks for participating in The Modding Trials. Now that the coding session has ended, we need you to give us a few details before people can vote for your mod. If you have come this far in the trials, and your mod is in a completely unpresentable state, you can reply to this email requesting to drop out. Please do not fill out the form in this case. Keep in mind that a mod doesn't need to be finished to be voted on! Most mods should be fairly work in progress anyway.
