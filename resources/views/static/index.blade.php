        <h2>News</h2>
        <p>Hello! Sad to say, but The Modding Trials voting is now over. TMT has been very fun, both with /u/Rushmead’s beautiful opening ceremony of cringyness and memes, and with spending a couple days on our booth server where we’ve seen many players mess with fun new TMT mods.
            </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, TMT has not gone perfectly smoothly. Unsuprisingly, putting 32 brand new mods made in 96 hours on one server together, is not quite the easiest thing ever. Our team has worked very hard to try to give you guys a stable experience for you to enjoy and vote for the mods, but after a few days of the server being up, we ran into some serious issues. Once we ran out of space to store backups, we were pretty screwed. Then we kept getting world corruption and then this happened. Without any recent backups, we realised this simply wasn’t going to work, so we shut down the server.
        </p>
            <p>If you didn’t get a chance to vote, I’m very sorry about that ;( Hopefully you’ll have a chance to vote in TMT2. Whether you voted or not, please fill out this feedback form so we know what to change for TMT2: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/NIG8oF133SwjHopo2">https://goo.gl/forms/NIG8oF133SwjHopo2</a>
            We would very much appreciate it if everyone here filled out the above form.
                </p>
            Let’s quickly take a look at our original schedule:<br>
            July 19th (19/7/16) - Entries Open - 12pm<br>
            August 2nd (2/8/16) - Entries Close - 12pm<br>
            August 5th (5/8/16); - Stream & Opening Ceremony (~11am UTC+1) & Coding Starts (12pm UTC+1)<br>
            August 8th (8/8/16) - Coding Ends (12pm UTC+1)<br>
            August 9th - 10th (9/8/16 - 10/8/16) - Server and Booth Preparation<br>
            August 11th (11/8/16) - Voting Starts<br>
            August 17th (17/8/16) - Voting Ends<br>
            August 19th (19/8/16) - Winner is Announced<br>
            <p>It starts out accurate, but TMT did not go quite according to plan. First, we had to push back voting because the server was not ready yet, and now we’ve had to end it early, also because of server issues. Going forward, we want to rely on the server less, and provide alternate ways of people playing with the mods, by providing individual downloads to the mods, and hopefully getting some more screenshots of the mods in action.
            </p>
        <p>If you have any other feedback that doesn’t fit in the form anywhere, please leave it in the comments. If you’re excited about the future for TMT, the best way is to make sure everyone knows about it. That’s the main factor in a competition. We need modders to participate, and we need people to vote.

            </p>
        <p>Now this brings me to my last point, voting. We had a really nice turn out, in my opinion at least. We had 270 people vote. The winners of TMT will be announced two days from now: Tuesday, August 16th, 2016. Stay tuned!
